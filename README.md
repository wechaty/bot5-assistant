## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install

```sh
npm install wechaty-bot5-assistant --save
```

### Step 2: Make a bot

```sh
$ vim mybot.js

import { WechatyBuilder } from 'wechaty'
import { Bot5Assistant } from 'wechaty-bot5-assistant'

const bot = WechatyBuilder.build()

bot.use(Bot5Assistant({
  room: [
    /^BOT5/,
  ]
}))
.on('scan', (url, code) => console.log(`Scan QR Code to login: ${code}\n${url}`))
.on('login', user => console.log(`User ${user} logged in`))
.start()
```

### Step 3: Run

```sh
node mybot.js
```

## Options

```ts
const DEFAULT_CONFIG = {
  // Which room(s) you want the bot to work with.
  // Can be a RegExp (for topic) or a function (filter room instance)
  // E.g. room: function (room) { room.topic().indexOf('我的') > -1 }
  room: [/BOT5/i, 'room_id@chatroom'],
}
```

## RSVP.ai

RSVP.ai is a machine-learning company that provides deep natural language understanding services for conversation-styled applications. It grew out of a collaboration between Tsinghua University and University of Waterloo.

RSVP.ai is a small and dedicated team making the smart machines today become the thinking machines tomorrow.

## Finate State Machine (FSM)

It's a finite state machine, which means it has a finite number of states.

> Huan(202110): the above line is auto generated by GitHub Pilot.

We are trying to use [XState](https://xstate.js.org/) to implement the FSM and using FSM to manage our meeting state transitions.

Currently we are just getting started, you can learn more about the BOT5 Club Meeting FSM at <https://wechaty.github.io/bot5-assistant/>
