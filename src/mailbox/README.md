A XState wrapper to implement Mailbox of Actor Model.

## Motivation

I'm building assistant chatbot for Wechaty community, and I want to use actor model based on XState to implement it.

My actor will receive message from Wechaty, and send message to Wechaty.

However, ... (describe the async & multi-user scanerio for the conversation turns)

It turns out ... (describe that we need to make sure the incoming messages are queued when we not finished processing the last one)

## Actor Mailbox Concept

In actor model, we must follow that: "if you send 3 messages to the same actor, it will just execute one at a time."

> Actors have mailboxes

```text
It’s important to understand that, although multiple actors can run at the same time, an actor will process a given message sequentially. This means that if you send 3 messages to the same actor, it will just execute one at a time. To have these 3 messages being executed concurrently, you need to create 3 actors and send one message each.

Messages are sent asynchronously to an actor, that needs to store them somewhere while it’s processing another message. The mailbox is the place where these messages are stored.
```
